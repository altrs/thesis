      <br><br>I. Robots Have Stage Fright? <br><br>
      A robotic duck sits perched on a wooden stool, occasionally squawking off-key into a microphone. The only movement its mechanical body can do is coyly jerk its beak towards and away from the microphone. A robot accordian player is situated next to the duck, a few human fingers can be seen holding the accordion and pressing down on some of the treble keys. Big rubber boots support the machine’s base, but otherwise no other biological body parts can be seen – as if the creature has compressed itself and is hiding from its own incoherent tune. The drum hides halfway up the wall, and the pianist has only one hand teetering over keys of their keyboard, their arm extending from somewhere behind the curtain. Off stage, a disembodied leg writhes on the ground, moving as if it’s trying to escape the performance. On the other side of the room, a disembodied hand soothes itself by slowly moving its fingers in the corner. <br><br>
      This sorry-sight of a musical band is Tobias Bradford’s artistic take on anthropomorphizing machines. Imposing animal behaviors and mannerisms on autonomous objects is the main medium for Bradford. In an interview regarding his piece Stage Fright, the artist states, “it is quite a primal thing to [...] project human qualities onto objects, especially the ones that specifically sort of invite that interpretation through various means– either that they are anthropomorphic in nature physically or that they act in anthropomorphic ways– as in like something seeming chaotic or unexpected or you know, sentient” Stage Fright is undoubtedly a striking work of art; However, while Bradford’s distinguished creation stands out for tackling the topic of anthropomorphism in such eerie, unsettling, and contemplative ways, I argue that the motif of machines exhibiting human-like behavior is anything but unique in the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. <br><br>
      As Bradford contemplates this idea of machines either being anthropomorphic in nature or just acting in anthropomorphic ways, his piece can lead viewers to apply this question to their everyday technologies. Are we imposing persona on machines as we perceive them, or are animal behaviors deliberately/indeliberately infused within technologically innovative objects by the creators? How may seeing animal/humanistic mannerism and behavior within our technology impact the way in which we interact with those machines, and how in turn may that affect us?<br><br>
      To continue this train of thought, Stage Fright specifically tackles mannerisms relating to shame, humiliation, and embarrassment. These are all characteristics not commonly related to machinery or automation, as Bradford himself regards his robot creations as, “quite unimpressive or even disappointing” in contrast to common descriptors used for robots including, ‘efficient’, ‘precise’, or ‘advanced’.

  <div class="defining-shame text-div">
    <p class="text">
      <br><br>II. Defining Shame <br><br>
      The American Psychological Association defines shame as “a highly unpleasant self-conscious emotion arising from the sense of there being something dishonorable, immodest, or indecorous in one's own conduct or circumstances.” As most readers can likely agree from personal experience, this definition of shame rings true. However, diving deeper into how shame often manifests itself, one can view shame as a matter of visibility and agency. Framing shame in these specific terms can further help us better relate shame to technology: <br><br>
      Visibility and invisibility at the center of technology, brings before us the signiﬁcance of exposure and privacy in any consideration of shame. New and expanding forms of connectivity [within technology] mean that discussions of urgent issues such as how our psyches are modiﬁed by the increasing loss of control over our personal data in the so-called Age of Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff, 2019) may be usefully informed by reﬂection upon shame as an indelible marker of human affectivity.”<br><br>
      With this in mind, one can begin to see the inextricable ties that technology has to shame, specifically technology that documents our lives, that we use to express ourselves, etc.Going a step further, public shame is also another concept this essay delves into. Public shaming’s function is of course founded on the definitions explored above. Public shaming should be especially noted as it has uses for productive community development, but has many caveats -- specifically in regards to public shaming on social media. Public shaming is also often spoken about in terms of ‘status’: “At a most basic level, public shaming involves public expressions of moral disapproval of some wrongdoer that marks that wrongdoer as having a defective status.”<br><br>
      While shame holds negative connotations, shame has undeniable functionality within society.  The APA states, “shame is [...] theorized to play a more positive adaptive function by regulating experiences of excessive and inappropriate interest and excitement and by diffusing potentially threatening social behavior” With this in mind, one other concept of shame that should be noted is the difference between reintegrative versus disintegrative shaming as established by criminologist John Braithwaite. To summarize Braithwaite’s concept, “While reintegrative shaming focuses on promoting cooperative behavior in individuals for the sake of the community, disintegrative shaming focuses on protecting a community from particularly deviant individuals.” Reintegrative shame is characterized by the following: it is temporary, it “does not push the shamed toward even worse patterns of behavior,” it does not isolate individuals, and it “allows individuals to hold themselves accountable through the actions of others.” Disintegrative shame is characterized by a permanence aspect (i.e. branding or maiming), this permanence leaves no room for redemption and likely deprives a community of a potential cooperator. By differentiating shame with these concepts in mind, we have a baseline for determining whether or not shame in certain situations can ultimately benefit one another, or permanently harm an individual and subsequently, their community.

      <br><br>III. Positive Environments<br><br>
      Summarize what it means to make environments more positive, and how unshaming/shame-ifying it can help.<br><br>
      A valid question one could ask is, ‘why does it matter if a robot has stage fright?’ and ‘what does that have to do with me?’ As Brian Christian, science fiction writer and winner of Loebner’s ‘Most Human Human Award’ puts it, “the march of technology isn't just changing how we live, it's raising new questions about what it means to be human.” Whilst innovative tech companies strive to have their name headline media outlets due to their most human-like robot, most realistic virtual environment, most accurate reality simulation, most intelligent artificial intelligence etc., it is as if each new step towards ‘hi’-technologies end up producing something that ultimately just further reveals what actual intelligence, realism, humanism, etc. is not.

      <br><br>IV. Positive Environments<br><br>
      Discuss shame-less environments, its benefits, what it is, and what it not is.<br><br>
      An integral aspect of technology is its ability to document information, to store words, pictures, videos, and more. Digital storage capabilities revolutionized communication and systems of information, allowing for greater information accessibility and preservation. As stated within the article ‘Technologies of Memory,’ “ Embedded within much technological discourse is a Utopian, techno-centric belief in an infallible memory-machine, in contrast to a notionally capricious, context-dependent and therefore fallible human memory.” Thus, technology’s superior capacity for information storage is undeniable, so much so that humans increasingly rely on digital memory as an extension of their own. While a large aspect of digital storage is its superior capabilities that far exceed that of its human creators, the way in which these technologies are developed take major influence from human behavior and cognition. For example, the term ‘contextual computing’ refers to, “[using] time, location and personal rhythm, task or activity, along with models of human memory practices, to help people manage their everyday lives via information storage and/or reminder.”

      <br><br>V. Technology and personal expression<br><br>
      Technology and personal expression.<br><br>
      Taking a closer look at this relationship between humans and machines, one can start to see how our technological memory can in some cases be detrimental. One fascinating example of developed co-dependence between humans and machines is the overreliance on GPS devices.<br><br>
      At first appearances, the increasing usage of these wayfinding technologies is freeing us from the burden of a tedious cognitive task (“where am I?” “How do I get to where I want to go?”). [...] [However] The very tools for navigability that are offered to us implicitly limit our ability to make choices by shaping the very way in which we navigate in our environments, potentially making some choices imperceptible. [...] ongoing usage of these devices make them more and more heavily entrenched in our decision-making processes.<br><br>
      While this example leans cynical when confronting how we might come to view advancing technologies, it’s greatly important to distinguish what will come to be viewed as a detrimental or non-detrimental effect on technology users. Especially given that with every gain that comes from innovation, loss occurs as well. Something to keep at the forefront of our minds is that, “growth has become this unmarked category granted magical powers. As growth remains

      One does not have to look far to see the ways in which social bots (including chatbots, virtual assistants, humanoids, etc.) mimic the behaviors and mannerisms of humans. ChatGPT has come to be notorious for its proficiency in natural language processing. Virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa and Bixby are a casual ‘Hey [insert robot’s name]’ call away on any mobile device. Various humanoid robots are being developed, including Hanson Robotic’s Sofia, the first citizen robot; Boston Dynamics’ ATLAS, mainly being developed for search and rescue missions; and Nadine, a social robot who worked as a customer service agent, among many others in development today. All of these robots have varying degrees of ability and speciality skills, including speaking many different languages, emotion recognition, memory recall, and even backflips in ATLAS’s case.

      ✸ Livingston, Julie. Self-Devouring Growth : A Planetary Parable As Told from Southern Africa. Durham: Duke University Press, 2019. Accessed May 13, 2024. ProQuest Ebook Central. “Self Devouring Growth” is a book that critically explores technological advancements and its effects, both positive and negative. Livingston overall argues that an imbalanced global pursuit of economic and technological growth has and will continue to lead to ecological, and societal destruction. This book is relevant to my project as I want to demonstrate through my project various downfalls of utilizing technology in certain contexts, arguing that tech advancements should be examined on a deeper level.<br><br>

Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-86144-5_42 The book, “Perspectives On Digital Humanism” is a collection of essays where the connection between humans and technology are examined, focusing on the potential for information technologies, while also considering privacy violations, ethical concern and other nuanced topics. This book will be highly relevant to my project as, specifically the chapter, “The Need for Respectful Technologies,” will help me understand the concepts of data privacy in conjunction with the well being of individuals, promoted through emerging technologies. The author puts emphasis on the importance of contextual costs of well being technologies.<br><br>

In: Mayer, https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-59527-2 The book, “Shame 4.0: Investigating an Emotion in Digital Worlds and the Fourth Industrial Revolution” explores future life for individuals and the cognitive effects of technology when considering humans. A main aspect of this piece of literature is that they discuss transforming negative emotions in increasingly technologised cultures. This is specifically related to my project as an aspect of my proposed solution is likely regarding how we might take the current state of shame within technology and disassemble it further to become a positive aspect of everyday life.<br><br>

      ✸ Babushkina, Dina. "What does it mean for a robot to be respectful?." Techné: Research in Philosophy and Technology (2022). https://www.pdcnet.org/8525763B0050E6F8.pdf Babushkina’s article is an academic article regarding research in philosophy and technology. The article is an argumentative essay about how robots have the ability to be respectful. The main argument is as follows: robot respectfulness is governed by distinct principles that reflect the maker’s attitude towards respect, and further that respect is the values that make an individual a person. The specific part relevant to my project is the author’s argument that the makers and creators of a technology should be scrutinized (i.e. their values and morals) and how or how not those values seep into their created robots. This text is integral to my project as it explores the relationship between technology and creator, rather than just viewing the entities in separate light.<br><br>

Violence Against Women, 21(6), 758-779. https://doi.org/10.1177/1077801215576581 This piece of literature is a research article that delves into the topic of technology and sexual violence. The aim of the article is to explore the various ways in which gender hierarchies and inequalities manifest online. The main argument is that the problematic dualism of cyberspace versus physical space reduces and abstracts the issue of ‘embodied harms.’ The article goes over gender, space and technology as well as the real harms of digital abuse and what that means for things such as the resentment of the body. This argument is relevant to my project because it thoroughly encapsulates the relations between shame embedded and encouraged through technology. It adds to my project as it uncovers the unseen ways in which technology (generally associated with hubris) in actuality permeates negative humility.
